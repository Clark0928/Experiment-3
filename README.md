## EXPERIMENT 3
# PYTHON DATA ANALYSIS (PANDAS)
## I. Overview:
###### This repository focuses on the use of Python Data Analysis (PANDAS) Library, and its various functions and codes. PANDAS is a core Python library that provides high-performance,
easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. This will be used to analyze the data from the cars.csv file both easy and intuitive.
## II. Intended Learning Outcomes:
###### 1. To identify the codes and functions incorporated in the Pandas library
###### 2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Pandas library
## III. Instructions:
###### - Write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. You may submit your Jupyter notebook in the dedicated submission bin.
###### - For this programming assignment, download the following file and save to your default user folder: http://bit.ly/Cars_file
### A. PROBLEM 1: Save your file as Surname_Pandas-P1.py
##### Using knowledge obtained from the experiment and demonstrations:
###### a. Load the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas
###### b. Display the first five and last five rows of the resulting cars.
### B. PROBLEM 2: Save your file as Surname_Pandas-P2.py
##### Using the dataframe cars in problem 1, extract the following information using subsetting, slicing and indexing operations.
###### a. Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7...) of cars.
###### b. Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’.
###### c. How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have?
###### d. Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models ‘Mazda RX4 Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’ and ‘Honda Civic’ have.
